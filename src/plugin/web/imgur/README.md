# Imgur plugin

The Imgur plugin responds to Imgur image URLs with some details about the image to whichever room the URL is mentioned in.
In order to do this, it accesses Imgur's v3 API. This requires a Client ID (stored in the json config).
To generate a Client ID, login to Imgur and [register a client](https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/addclient).

API docs can be found [here](http://api.imgur.com).
